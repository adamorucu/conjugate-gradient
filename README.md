# Conjugate Gradient Method

This repository contains a speed-optimised implementation of the conjugate gradient descent.
It also holds a [report](report.pdf) that was written describing the steps I took while optimising it.
The data used to test the method is placed in the data folder but more can be generated using the `./generate_data.py --size <matrix size>` file. 
The time it takes the program to terminate for different matrix sizes can be studied using `./timings.py`
